            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              My name is Moumita Datta and I am an aspiring web/software
              developer.At the time I had no clue what I was getting into, I
              just thought the world of computers seemed really cool and always
              was curious to learn. Since then I have learned quite a bit on
              algorithms, data structures, OOP and web development and the open
              source Odin Project. While my learning journey has been a bit
              sporadic since I had other things to attend to in life, I am now
              in a position where I am fully commiting to this path<br />
              When I am not coding I enjoy reading, music, going for walks, and
              watching series.

              <br />Thanks again for checking me out, much Love.
            </p>
